* JSON stand for JavaScript Object Notation and is a data format for simple data (see json.org and jsonlint.com)
  * an array [] of values
  * an object/hash/map {}  (containing key:values)
  * a value can be an array,object,string,float,boolean, or null
* in most engines/frameworks, a sprite is an onscreen graphic
* if you can figure out a way to segment your game data from your game logic, loading your data at runtime is extremly useful
* a for-each statement is a way to iterate a list of known object type where you don't need to know the order


Class 4 Homework
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* detect when castling is possible and make button to let you castle (hint: you can edit the initial layout so you don't have to play into this state)
* add a variable for whose turn it is (p1 or p2). show whose turn it is with text on screen and only allow the current player to take a move.
* when a player's king is taken, transition to a game over screen that shows which player has won
  
* BONUS
  * detect when a player is in check and show something on screen to let players know
  * add a "back to menu" button to the game over screen that returns you to the main menu
  * reset the state of the board when a player presses the start button on the main menu
