Class 4 Cheat Sheet
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* JSON stand for JavaScript Object Notation and is a data format for simple data (see json.org and jsonlint.com)
  * an array [] of values
  * an object/hash/map {}  (containing key:values)
  * a value can be an array,object,string,float,boolean, or null
* in most engines/frameworks, a sprite is an onscreen graphic
* if you can figure out a way to segment your game data from your game logic, loading your data at runtime is extremly useful


Class 4 Homework
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* detect when castling is possible and make button to let you castle (hint: you can edit the initial layout so you don't have to play into this state)
* detect when a player is in check and show something onscreen to let players know
* either: add a concede button for each player so the checkmated player can concede -OR- detect when a player is in checkmate
* add a game over screen that shows which player has won
  
* BONUS
  * create a gameplay variant. maybe black has 3 queens and white has all pawns. maybe bishops and rooks can only move up to 3 spaces (like a knight). maybe the pieces respawn on the back row.
