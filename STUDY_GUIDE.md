#Intro Game Programming Study Guide
This study guide is meant to be a scavenger hunt through this quarter's sample code, but also requires you to describe in words what each concept means. Using the format provided, fill out the study guide "Required for Final Project" and "Optional for Final Project" sections using the format below. For each question, you must:

* copy/paste the question into your own document
* put your answer below the question
* put a link to a file in the github repository that illustrates the concept
* put a line number (or multiple line numbers) in that file


## Example Questions / Answers:

Q: What is a variable?

A: A variable is a named thing that can hold a value of a specific type. Whenever you type that name later, you get back that value. In the reference below we're storing the value 7 in the variable named "x".

Example: https://github.com/SimianLogic/ITGM220_W15/blob/master/00_practice/processing/sketch_02/sketch_02.pde

Line: 1

Q: What is the difference between a primitive and an object?

A: A primitive is a built-in data type like int or boolean. An object is a custom class made up of variables and functions. Most primitives can be assigned in-line, but with variables you have to use the "new" keyword.

Primitive Example: https://github.com/SimianLogic/ITGM220_W15/blob/master/00_practice/processing/sketch_02/sketch_02.pde

Line: 1

Object Example: https://github.com/SimianLogic/ITGM220_W15/blob/master/00_practice/processing/sketch_25/sketch_25.pde

Line: 2 (declared) and 11 (instantiated)
