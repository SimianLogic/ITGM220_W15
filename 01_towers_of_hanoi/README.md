Class 1 Homework
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* download the Towers of Hanoi code from Github (https://github.com/SimianLogic/ITGM220_W15)
* add a variable to track how many moves have been taken (where a move is pickup + put down) and display it onscreen somewhere (see "text")
* add an additional ring to the puzzle (5 rings instead of 4)
* make it so the game doesn't allow me to make an invalid move (I can only put a small ring on a larger ring)
* change the colors so that each ring is a distinct color
