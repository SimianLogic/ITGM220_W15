# Photoshop Scripting Homework (Optional)

This homework assignment is OPTIONAL. If you feel you need an extra grade to balance out earlier assignments, go for it!

(You can use the export_icons demo as an example -- most of this stuff is super dense/complicated, so Google is your friend)


* in the homework folder is a PSD called recreate_me.psd
* write a JSX (photoshop script) file that exports the metadata needed to recreate the file in code:
    * for a text layer, export the font/font-size/color/alignment/position/text etc
    * for a non-text layer, export the bounds (rectangle) and the image
    * write your metadata to a text file
    
* in processing, create a sketch and add all of the exported images. either paste the metadata into your sketch as a variable or read it from disc and re-create the photoshop file using only code (no hand-placement of images/text)


To grade this assignment, I'm going to delete all the assets from your sketch, re-run your script, and see if it works when I move over the assets/metadata.
