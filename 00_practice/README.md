# PRACTICE

###01
* print the string "Hello World" to the console

###02
* declare an int primitive and assign it a value on the same line.
* print the value to the console

###03
* declare a float primitive and assign it a value on the same line;
* print the value to the console

###04
* declare a boolean primitive with value = true
* declare a string object with a value of "test1"
* declare a string object with a value of "test2"
* write a conditional (if) statement that prints the variable with "test1" if the variable is true and vice versa
* run the sketch and make sure it prints the right value. change the default value and run again.

###05
* write a for-loop which prints all the numbers from 0 to 9

###06
* write a for-loop which prints all the numbers from 1 to 10

###07
* declare an array of ints with the values 0-9 on one line

###08
* declare an array of 10 ints with no assigned value
* use a for loop to assign the values from 0-9

###09
* change the size of the sketch to 800x600

###10
* change the size of the sketch to 800x600 
* change the color of the background to blue

###11
* implement the setup and draw functions with a message to the console in each

###12
* create an 800x600 program 
* draw a BLUE rectangle centered at the mouse's location every frame

###13
* create an 800x600 program 
* draw a BLUE rectangle centered at the mouse's location every frame when the mouse is NOT PRESSED
* draw a RED rectangle when the mouse IS PRESSED

###14
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* draw a BLUE rectangle centered at the mouse's location every frame when the mouse is NOT PRESSED
* draw a RED rectangle when the mouse IS PRESSED

###15
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* create a helper function to draw a BLUE column at the mouse's position.

###16
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* use file-level variables to declare a min and max x value
* when within the minX and maxX, draw a red column. 
* otherwise draw a blue column.

###17
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* use file-level variables to declare a min and max x value
* when within the minX and maxX, draw a red column. 
* otherwise draw a blue column.
* declare a variable for columnWidth and only draw the column at stepped x-values (i.e. 50,100,150)

###18
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* use file-level variables to store the mouseX/mouseY when the mouse is pressed
* use a file-level boolean variable to store whether currently dragging or not
* set isDragging = true on mousePressed and isDragging = false on mouseReleased
* draw a circle from the mousePressed point to the current point while dragging and after release
* clear the circle for a new circle each time we press the mouse

###19
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* create a 2D array of booleans, 4x4
* write a helper function to return a random true or false
* in your setup function, assigne each value in the 4x4 grid to a random boolean value
* draw a 4x4 grid with white squares for true and black squares for false

###20
* create an 800x600 program that clears the screen each draw call
* create a 2D array of booleans, 4x4
* write a helper function to return a random true or false
* in your setup function, assigne each value in the 4x4 grid to a random boolean value
* draw a 4x4 grid with white squares for true and black squares for false
