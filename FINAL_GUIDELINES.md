## Overall Grading Guidelines for Final Project
1. Must have at least 3 screens (typically Menu/Splash, Gameplay, and Game Over)
2. Must have a written design/description of the game. (It's an endless runner with procedurally placed platforms and double-jumping).
3. The "rules" of the game must be consistent with your design (i.e. if you were doing Towers of Hanoi you'd have to make it so you can't put down big discs on small discs).

## Checklist for Final Project
1. Use at least 1 local variable and one class variable.
1. Use at least 1 mutable container class.
1. Use at least 1 immutable container class.
1. Write at least 1 void function.
1. Write at least 1 non-void function.
1. One of your functions must take a parameter.
1. Write at least one conditional statement.
1. Use at least 1 logical operator -- AND, OR, NOT
1. Use at least 1 for loop.
1. Write at least 1 custom class with a constructor.
1. Create at least 1 instance of your class.
1. Make use of at least 1 built-in class (stored in a variable, instantiated).
1. You must load at least 1 image and display it on screen (but more is better! Polish helps).
1. You must render dynamic text on screen (like a high score or turn counter).
1. You must be able to "play" indefinitely without stopping/starting the game (a New Game button that actually starts a new game)

## "Polish" Elements for Final Project
These are examples of things that can be done to elevate your project into A territory.

1. Add sound effects.
2. Add animated elements (think code-animation, not sprite sheets) -- do buttons "move" or "squish" when you click on them? Do elements fade or transition in or just pop into place? 
3. Add some sort of high score persistence. Can I replay to get a better high score?
4. Art it up! Make it look super cool (note that this doesn't require any programming skill, so if you're struggling with the code just make somethign simple and polish the heck out of it)
5. Add extra screens. Maybe you have a start screen that leads into a level select screen.
