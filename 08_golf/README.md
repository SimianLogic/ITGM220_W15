# MiniGolf Homework
* Add 9 Holes of Golf (i.e. make 9 total levels). Add a button for each level on the menu scene.
* Create a GameOver scene and transition to that scene once the player gets the ball in the goal
* On the GameOver scene, add a button that transitions back to the menu scene
* On the GameOver scene, show which level the player finished and how many shots they took (use the static Player variables)
* Create a rotating hazard (a custom MonoBehaviour) in at least one of your levels

* BONUS
  * add a check-mark sprite below each button on the home screen for whether that level has been completed or not
  * add a label below each button on the home screen for "best score" on that level
  * on the home screen, show your total score across all 9 levels
